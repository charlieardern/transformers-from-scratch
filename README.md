# Transformers from Scratch
Learning about transformers by implementing them from scratch.

## Contents
- **Vanilla Transformer**: My first go at implementing an encoder. Nothing interesting as I didn't test it.
- **Machine Translation**: Building and training a model to translate English to French. Still a work in progress.

Unless otherwise stated, the images and diagrams are my own - feel free to use them.
