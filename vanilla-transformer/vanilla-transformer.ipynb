This can be implemented efficiently with one matrix operation by using `nn.Linear`. We construct a large matrix, of dimension `(batch_size, sequence_length, 3*d*h)`. This will have all required matrices concatenated along `dim=2`.\n- Note that $d$ is the dimension of each token, $h$ is the number of heads and the 3 comes about as we are consturcting 3 matrices (Q,K,V) for each head. (See the image below)\n- Note that `nn.Linear` is designed to compute operations on a vector so it will perform the same operation on each token of each batch.\nHere we see the operation carried out by the linear layer:\n<img src=\"X to QKV.png\" alt =\"X to QKV layer\" width=300>\n\nAnd looking more closely at the output:\n<img src=\"QKV_matrix.png\" alt=\"QKV Matrix\" width=\"300\"/>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def scaled-dot-product(X, inner_dim):\n    ","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
